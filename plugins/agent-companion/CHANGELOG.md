# Changelog

All notable changes to the `agent-companion` plugin. Dates are UTC.

## 0.24.1 — 2026-09-23

Folds a measured 30-day cache-TTL finding into the routing model (patch
bump — advisory-only detection surface, no breaking change).

### Added

- **`config/model-tiers.json`: `cacheTtl` block.** Per-definition
  prompt-cache-TTL recommendation — default `5m`; `1h` recommended only for
  opus-tier, long-lived roles (architect/reviewer/lead), with the generic
  `ac-*` ladder workers explicitly excluded (one-shot, so `1h`'s 2x write
  multiplier has nothing to earn back). Records the evidence (30-day
  measurement, 1,407 subagent transcripts, `~/.claude/reports/2026-09-23-subagent-cache-ttl.md`)
  and a re-measure date of 2026-10-07. Frontmatter shape/precedence/pricing
  verified live 2026-09-23 against code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents,
  code.claude.com/docs/en/prompt-caching, and
  platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching — the
  `experimental.cacheTtl` field (nested, `5m`/`1h` only, requires Claude
  Code v2.1.248+) matches what the earlier finding described.
- **`scripts/checks.mjs` (`agent-defs`): cache-TTL advisory.** An opus-tier
  definition whose name or description marks it long-lived
  (architect/reviewer/lead) with no `cacheTtl` set gets a suggestion to add
  `experimental: { cacheTtl: "1h" }`. A haiku or `ac-*` ladder definition
  already set to `1h` gets a note that it likely costs more, not less.
  Both are advisory findings (`warn`, never `fail`) — new
  `tests/cache-ttl-advisory.test.mjs`.
- **`tests/model-mismatch.test.mjs`: replaced the toothless
  "near-simultaneous spawns" test.** Its own comment admitted a naive
  per-row-in-order matcher passed it too, so it never exercised the swap
  bug the shipped delta-sorted matcher exists to prevent. The new fixture
  is built so a naive matcher provably mis-pairs (verified by hand: it
  produces 2 false `alias_mismatch` findings), while the shipped matcher
  produces zero.

### Fixed

- **`docs/proposed/global-doctrine-reweight.patch`: line-ending bug.** The
  header wrongly claimed both target files (CLAUDE.md and
  `skills/team-orchestration/SKILL.md`) use CRLF; CLAUDE.md is pure LF.
  Corrected the header and the apply instructions: the patch is stored as
  plain LF throughout (this repo's own `.gitattributes` forces
  `*.patch text eol=lf`, which silently strips any literal `\r` a tracked
  `.patch` file's content might otherwise carry — verified by staging a
  byte-preserved draft and reading the blob back), and applying it now
  documents the two invocations (with per-file `core.autocrlf` handling)
  verified byte-exact against both real targets. Also amends the SKILL.md
  "resume by name" guidance (resume only within 5 minutes of a worker
  stopping, or when its definition runs on a 1h cache) and corrects the
  "caching is already solved" line (the hit ratio is high; the misses are
  the 5–60 minute rewrites).
- **`docs/proposed/global-doctrine-reweight.patch`: removed from this
  public repo.** The file quoted lines from the operator's private
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `team-orchestration` SKILL.md, including the
  operator's name -- content that does not belong in a public repo. Copied
  byte-identical to the operator's own `~/.claude/proposed/` directory and
  `git rm`'d here; the doctrine patch is kept outside this repo from now
  on. References to its in-repo path elsewhere in this plugin's docs and
  config were updated to point at "the operator's global-doctrine patch,
  kept outside this repo" instead of the removed path. (The file is still
  recoverable from this branch's git history if needed.)

## 0.24.0 — 2026-09-23

Implements the operator-approved SPAWNING RULE (three checks; minor bump —
new detection surface, no breaking change to any existing check's shape).

### Added

- **`hooks/spawn-guard.mjs`: missing-model warning.** A spawn naming no
  model anywhere (neither the spawn parameter nor its definition) is now
  flagged even when the brief declares no `WEIGHT:` — previously silent,
  since `fit_autofill` only fills a model in off a declared weight. The
  existing "no effort stated" warning's wording is unified around, and
  cites, the same rule.
- **`hooks/spawn-guard.mjs`: build-version-floor warning.** An opus/fable
  spawn from a session whose own Claude Code build is below
  `config/model-tiers.json`'s `aliasResolution.minClaudeCodeVersion` is
  flagged, reading the build from the CALLING session's own transcript
  (`sessionBuildVersion()`, new in `hooks/lib/context.mjs`) rather than
  shelling out to `claude --version` — a session's build can differ from
  what's on PATH (the desktop app bundles its own), and a session keeps
  the build it started with. Falls back to silence when unreadable, never
  a guess.
- **`scripts/lib/model-mismatch.mjs` + the `model-resolution-mismatch`
  audit check.** Verifies the model a spawn actually ran on (its subagent
  transcript's own resolved model) against what its definition's alias
  should resolve to. Correlates `spawns.jsonl` telemetry to subagent
  transcripts by nearest timestamp within a session (no field links the
  two directly), matched by closest-pair-first rather than
  per-row-in-order — the latter produced a measured false positive on real
  data under near-simultaneous spawns. Bounded to a fixed 48h window
  regardless of `--days` (an unbounded transcript walk over every project
  measured over two minutes).
- `parseSemver`/`semverBelow` moved from `scripts/detect.mjs` into
  `hooks/lib/context.mjs`, now shared by the scout's harness-version
  signal, the new spawn-guard warning, and the new audit check, so "below
  the floor" cannot drift into separate definitions.
- `docs/proposed/global-doctrine-reweight.patch`: extended with a new
  "The SPAWNING RULE" subsection in the `team-orchestration` SKILL.md hunk
  and a second pointer sentence in the CLAUDE.md hunk (still a pointer,
  not a restatement — CLAUDE.md stays slim). Verified applying cleanly
  against fresh copies of both real target files.
- README: new "Spawning rule" section; Features table row.
- 17 new tests (`tests/spawning-rule.test.mjs`,
  `tests/model-mismatch.test.mjs`); full suite 173/0 (was 156/0).

## 0.23.0 — 2026-09-23

Re-weighted `config/model-tiers.json` against the current Anthropic lineup
(live-fetched 2026-09-23; sources cited inline in the config).

### Changed

- **Re-based the routing table** on the current lineup: `opus` -> Opus 5.5
  ($4/$20, cache hit $0.20, medium default effort), `sonnet` -> Sonnet 5
  ($2/$10), `haiku` -> Haiku 4.5 ($1/$5, no effort parameter, retires no
  sooner than 2026-10-15), `fable` -> Fable 5.1 ($10/$50, cache hit $0.25).
  Every tier now carries a `resolvesTo` block (model id, display name,
  pricing incl. cache hit, context, effort support/default, thinking mode)
  plus a top-level `aliasResolution` naming the source, fetch date, and the
  minimum Claude Code version (2.1.280) the mapping holds for.
- **Added `referenceModels`**: non-routable entries for OLDER pinned
  full/dated ids (Opus 5, Fable 5, Opus 4.8/4.7/4.6, Sonnet 4.6), so an
  agent definition pinned to one of these has its effort validated against
  what THAT version actually supports (Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6 have no
  `xhigh`) instead of the current alias tier's wider list.
- **Added an ordered effort ladder** (`config.ladder`): the same routing
  grid's (model, effort) pairs as a cheapest-to-dearest sequence — haiku,
  then sonnet low..xhigh, then opus low..max — each mapped to a new generic
  worker agent definition under `agents/` (`ac-haiku` .. `ac-opus-max`),
  because the Agent tool has no per-spawn effort parameter. `recommend.mjs`
  now prints the exact namespaced spawnable name for its recommendation.
  Weight -> rung defaults are unchanged (1-2 haiku, 3 sonnet/medium, 4
  sonnet/high, 5 opus/xhigh) pending a separate research decision.
- **Added `verify` and `operate` task types**, encoding "haiku validates,
  it does not OPERATE": read/confirm/screenshot work with nothing changing
  routes to weight 1 (haiku); an ordered procedure or a live-system change
  floors at weight 3 (sonnet+) even when every individual step looks
  trivial.
- Fable's warrant now cites Anthropic's own escalation criterion ("Opus
  5.5 at higher effort still falls short") and notes Fable is now 2.5x
  Opus on price (was 2x, when Opus priced at $5/$25).
- The calibration scout (`scripts/detect.mjs`) now warns on every run once
  a tier is within 30 days of `retiresAfter` (previously only on fixed
  milestones, which stayed silent for haiku's 2026-10-15 date until this
  fix).
- `spawns.jsonl` gains `effective_effort`: the agent definition's own
  effort when stated, else `"inherited(<parent session's effort, or
  'unknown'>)"` — a subagent with no `effort` frontmatter inherits the
  orchestrating session's effort (per Claude Code's sub-agents docs), not
  any model default. `spawn-audit` gains a rung-drift finding for spawns
  that matched the recommended model but ran at a lower effort than the
  table recommended.
- `spawn-guard.mjs` and the `agent-defs` audit check now warn when a
  definition or spawn has a model but states no effort anywhere, on every
  effort-taking model (previously implied only for opus, and initially
  mis-described as falling back to a model default rather than to session
  inheritance — corrected same day).

### Documentation

- `docs/ROUTING.md` regenerated from the config (now includes the effort
  ladder and reference-models sections).
- `docs/TELEMETRY.md`: documents `effective_effort`, and adds a "Spawn
  nesting depth" section explaining why `depth` is NOT logged (the
  PreToolUse payload carries at most a 1-bit `caller_is_subagent` signal,
  not a true recursion depth) and what the harness would need to add.
- `docs/proposed/global-doctrine-reweight.patch`: unpublished unified diffs
  against `~/.claude/skills/team-orchestration/SKILL.md` and
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, for the operator to review and apply by hand.
