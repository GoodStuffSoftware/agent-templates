# agent-companion

Guardrails and calibration for agent teams. Every feature is independently
toggleable, and every guard fails open.

## Why

Orchestration rules written in `CLAUDE.md` are *aspirational*. They are delivered
as a user message competing with the user's latest request, and adherence drops
as the file grows. A rule about restraint — "delegate instead of doing it
yourself" — is the weakest kind, because the alternative is always more
convenient.

This plugin converts the rules that matter into structure.

It was built after two observed failures:

1. **Four premium-tier agents ran on a task that did not warrant one.** Nothing
   had gone wrong with the *choice* — subagents inherit the lead's model when
   nothing specifies one, so no choice was ever made. A better-worded rule could
   not have caught it. Only a default or a gate could.
2. **A routing table went stale without anyone noticing.** It was calibrated for
   a previous model generation, priced one tier ~33% too high, and had no row at
   all for the tier that was quietly costing the most.

## Features

| Toggle | Does | Blocks? |
|---|---|---|
| `delegation_guard` | Fires when the **main thread** runs `delegation_threshold` execution-class tools in a row. Inert inside every subagent. | nudge, with cooldown |
| `premium_cap` | Caps concurrent premium-tier subagents at `premium_max_concurrent`. | yes, at the cap |
| `warrant_required` | Premium spawns must carry a `WARRANT:` line stating task weight and why a cheaper tier will not do. | yes |
| `memory_budget` | Warns when always-loaded instruction files exceed `memory_budget_tokens`, and writes a ready-to-run refactor prompt. | no |
| `spawn_telemetry` | Records every spawn (model, agent type, effort) for the calibration routine. | no |

Premium tiers are **capped and audited, never banned**. The failure mode was
unexamined defaults, not the model itself.

## Design rules

**A hook must never break a session.** Every guard wraps in try/catch and falls
through to allow. Unparseable payload, unreadable state, unrecognised agent
type — all allow.

**Enforcement fails open; detection does not.** The main-thread test is a
positive allowlist (`main`, `main-session`). An agent type we do not recognise is
never blocked — but it *is* recorded to `unknown-agent-types.jsonl`, so a new
type introduced by a harness update surfaces in the next calibration run instead
of silently changing behaviour.

**Under-enforcement is the safe failure.** A guard that stops matching looks
identical to a guard that was never tripped, so the calibration routine treats a
denial count of **zero** as a signal to run the canary — not as good news.

## Configuration

Toggles are declared as `userConfig` and set per-user without editing plugin
files:

```json
{
  "pluginConfigs": {
    "agent-companion": {
      "delegation_guard": true,
      "delegation_threshold": 4,
      "premium_max_concurrent": 2,
      "memory_budget_tokens": 3000
    }
  }
}
```

## State

Written under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` (survives upgrades, removed on uninstall):

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `spawns.jsonl` | every `Agent` spawn: model, subagent type, effort |
| `subagent-starts.jsonl` | post-spawn confirmation |
| `unknown-agent-types.jsonl` | agent types not in the known set |
| `delegation-streak.json` | per-session main-thread streak counter |
| `premium-window.json` | rolling window used to approximate premium concurrency |
| `refactor-prompt.md` | generated when an instruction file is over budget |

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ./
claude plugin install agent-companion@agent-templates
```

For development, load it directly without installing:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/agent-companion
```

## Known limits

- Premium concurrency is **approximated** by a 10-minute rolling window, not by
  tracking live agents. A legitimate burst may need the cap raised rather than
  worked around.
- Token counts are estimated at ~4 chars/token. Fine for a budget alarm, not for
  billing.
- The warrant check is deterministic (it looks for the line). It verifies that a
  justification was *stated*, not that it is *good* — the audit does that.
