# Contributions Inbox

A holding area for generic improvements contributed back from real projects when no pull-request workflow is available. Entries here are **not yet applied** — a maintainer folds each one into its proper template/shared file (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) → "Where it goes") and then removes it from this file.

**This is a queue, not a home.** A change isn't "done" while it's only in the inbox.

## How to add an entry

Append a new dated entry at the **top** of the list (newest first), using the template below. Before adding it, run `node scripts/leak-check.mjs` — the entry must contain no real-world tokens (generalize specifics to `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` or generic examples first).

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>

- **Trigger:** what surfaced this (the gotcha / better step / missing rule).
- **Is it generic?** the result of the "is this generic?" test — what specifics were stripped, what reusable kernel remained.
- **Target:** where it should land. For a **rule, gotcha, or hard-won lesson** this is a new tagged file under `lessons/` — knowledge is never pasted into an agent def or into `anthropic/shared/cross-project-rules.md` (that page is a pointer and enumerates nothing). Use a template path (e.g. `anthropic/basic-site/agents/site-builder.md`) only for scaffolding changes.
- **Proposed change:** the actual generalized text / diff, with `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` in place of any real values.
- **Applied?** `no` (a maintainer flips this to `yes` and removes the entry once folded in).
```

## Fold history

- The twelve entries dated 2026-07-27 through 2026-08-02 were folded into `lessons/` on 2026-08-03 (`Applied? yes`, entries removed per the maintainer flow above).
- The thirteen entries dated 2026-08-03 through 2026-08-08 were folded into `lessons/` on 2026-08-10 (`Applied? yes`, entries removed). Twelve landed as new lesson files; the "write down what you measured, not what it implies about the category" entry was folded BY MEANING into the existing `scope-a-broken-finding-to-the-measured-path` lesson (title widened, `corroborated` raised) rather than duplicated.
